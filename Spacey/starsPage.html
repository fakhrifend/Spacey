              Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
              Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a
              half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
              combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the
              Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's
              night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since
              prehistoric times. It was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the
              king of the gods. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but
              helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its
              volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but,
              like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it lacks a
              well-defined solid surface.

              Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in
              the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average
              radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only
              one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
              volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn's interior is
              most likely composed of a core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon
              and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of
              metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and
              liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer.

              Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest
              to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the
              shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
              Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and
              mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
              Hermes. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar
              in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been
              geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no
              atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary
              diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System,
              ranging from 100 K (-173 °C; -280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C;
              800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.

              Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the
              Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object
              in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and
              can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit
              is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°;
              thus, at latitudes with a day-night cycle, it is most readily
              visible for up to a few hours following the start of sunset or
              before sunrise. At times, it has been seen in a completely dark
              sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic
              day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243
              Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
              than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the
              opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun
              rises from its western horizon and sets in its east.

              1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally
              thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later
              that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part
              because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel
              tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after
              King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's
              suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as
              suggested by Bode.

              Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the
              Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
              diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
              planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more
              massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and
              physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes
              more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is referred
              to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other
              one being its Uranus). More than 30 times as far from the Sun as
              Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible
              to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its
              discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit
              since its discovery in 1846.
